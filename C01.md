## Installing Golang compiler

A large fraction of the tools and frameworks used to run applications and emulate RISC-V processors are written in Golang (shortly Go). As such, the installation of the proper Go toolchain is a prerequisite for the correct compilation and installation of all the other frameworks and tools. 

Since the version of Go 1.4, the compiler is written in Go and thus is not possible to directly cross-compile the compiler (e.g., using GCC to compile the go sources and get the Go compiler. Rather it is required to use a **bootstrap toolchain**, i.e., basically a precompiled version of the tool(s) that can be used to build from scratch them by targeting a different architecture and version.

Let's assume the target architecture is **arch=riscv64** and the host machine is running Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) on a x86\_64 processor (AMD64). The following steps apply to have the toolchain correctly installed.
1. Create the target building folder:
```bash
	$ mkdir go-build
	$ cd go-build/
```
2. Download the Golang archive (go<version>.linux-amd64.tar.gz --note: the version of the compiler may change from the version used at the moment of writing this guide, that is the `go1.20.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz` which should match the operating system on the host, i.e., linux, and the host processor, i.e., AMD64). Versions of the sources/binaries can be checked here [golang src](https://go.dev/dl/).
3. Ensure that the binaries for building the bootstrapped version (i.e., targeting the OS and architecture of interest, i.e., RISCV64) are correctly installed, by removing all the previous installation:
```bash
	$ wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz 
	$ sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
	$ vim ~/.bashrc
	    export PATH="/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH"	
	$ source ~/.bashrc
``` 
4. Testing that the compiler is correctly installed:
```bash	
	$ go version
```
Once done, a bootstrap compilation toolchain should be available on the system. At this point, a building folder should be create in the system, and the bootstrap script invoked. To this end, let's assume that the `/home/<user>/workspace/` folder is created on the system. Then, the following steps apply:
	
1. Unpack the archive previously downloaded as follows: 
```bash
	$ tar -C . -xzf go1.20.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz 
```
3. Download the **bootstrap.bash** script. Open and copy on a file named `bootstrap.bash` the code locate at [bootstrap script](https://go.dev/src/bootstrap.bash?m=text) and make it executable. The script should be patched a bit in order to make it properly working; so, a patheched version is made available on this repository:
```bash
	$ chmod -x bootstrap.bash
```
4. Executing the bootstrap script stting the variables `GOOS` and `GOARCH` to the proper values for the targeted system, i.e., a Linux machine equipped with a RISCV-64 processor (physical or emulated). This should produce in the `../go-linux-riscv64/` folder the toolchain targeting the RISCV64 processor. It also creates archives in the `../go-linux-riscv64/archives` folder 
```bash 
	$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=riscv64 ./bootstrap.bash
```
The binaries created through this project can be copied to the target machine (or the emulated environment). At this point the building folder can be removed (if needed):
```bash
	$ rm -rf ../go-linux-riscv64/
```

## Qemu for RISCV-64
The Qemu version from the 6.x on are shipped without the 'slirp' module inside. So, it is required to compile this module in order to enable the Qemu binaries to run with the 'user' backend. In the following, the steps for compiling and enabling the slirp module are provided.

### SLIRP module
The slirp module can be downloaded and built from sources as follows:
1. Cloning the repository:
```bash
	$ git clone https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/slirp/libslirp.git
```
2. Configuring and building the module
```bash
	$ cd libslirp
	$ meson build
	$ sudo ninja -C build install
```

### Qemu binaries creation
This section covers the steps necessary to create the `qemu-system-riscv64` emulator (Qemu), which is the fast emulation solution for developing and running RISCV64 applications. As such, the Qemu platform provides a software emulation of a basic host machine running a RISCV64 compliant processor with all the relevant extensions enabled (memory, cryptographic, hypervisor, floating point multiplication/division).

The folllowing steps are used to build a working version of the `qemu-system-riscv64`:
1. Cloning the main Qemu branch from GitHub (note that at the momento of writing this documentation, the stable version is set to v8.0.0., so check online if a newer version is available):
```bash
	$ git clone --depth=1 --branch v8.0.0 https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu.git
```
2. Entering the cloned repository and create a temporary building directory:
```bash
	$ cd qemu
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build 
```
3. Configuring the compiler (note, the `--prefix` option is used to overide the default installation directory, and so it can be omitted):
```bash
	$ ../configure --target-list=riscv64-softmmu,riscv64-linux-user --enable-slirp --prefix=<myinstalldir>
```
4.  Compiling and installing the emulator binaries (where `$nproc` provides the number of physical CPU cores to parallelize the compilation process). Note that, depending on the specific permission of the selected desination directory (e.g., the system default one), the second command may require the use of `sudo`:
```bash
	$ make -j $(nproc)
	$ make install 
```
5. Removing the building folder and setting the folder owner to the current <user> of the host. This last command may be required depending on the permission of the destination folder:
```bash
	$ cd ..
	$ rm -rf build
	$ sudo chown -R $USER.$USER <myinstalldir>
```

Worth to mention, is that the installation binaries' folder can be conveniently added to the `$PATH` environmental variable in order to be able to launch the commands without poinintg the specific installation folder. Alternatively, it is possible to copy the binaries in one of the system directories (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`). 

The installed toolbox (i.e., <myinstalldir>/bin/) comprises a set of commands that are used to manage the creation and execution of emulated RISCV64 machines. Among the others, the following commands are relevant in the creation and startup of a new machine (note that all commands are prefixed with `qemu-`):
- `qemu-img`: allows to manage the creation of virtual hard-drives (i.e., images); virtual hard-drives are supported with various formats (qcow, qcow2, raw).
- `qemu-riscv64`: allows to emulate only the CPU execution (i.e., no I/O interfaces, disks, networks are emulated).
- `qemu-system-riscv64`: this is the primary way of running a virtual system; it allows to emulate the whole *system* that is the CPU along with all the peripherals and I/O devices. This is also the primary solution to run a OS (e.g., linux) to boot up a complete machine.
- `qemu-nbd`: manage virtual devices (i.e., a virtual disk) as network attached devices.

### Example -- Creating a small virtual disk
Through the above mentioned commands is possible to create a small virtual disk and mounting it on a local folder on the host.
1. The following command requires the sudo permission and loads on the host kernel the **nbd** module. This module allows to mount on the host machine *networked block devices*; the parameter specifies the maximum number of partitions that can be used in the mounting operation (e.g., `max_part=8` tells the kernel to allow the mounting of /dev/nbd0, /dev/nbd1, ..., /dev/nbd7 partitions).
```bash
	$ sudo modprobe nbd max_part=4
``` 
2. Create a small virtual disk using the `qemu-img`. The options of this command allow to specify the size (e.g., 512M) and format (e.g., qcow2) of the virtual disk. The following commands suppose to start from the installation directory of the Qemu toolbox. Note that the size of the disk can be easily expressed using the capitol letters M for mega(bytes) and G for giga(bytes). The `preallocation=full` parameter allows to allocate the whole disk space in advance; this strategy allows to reach better performance but it costs more in terms of space on the host storage system, since it does not grow dynamically. If performance are not critical, this parameter can be omitted, thus allowing the virtual disk to grow and shrink dynamically over the time. 
```bash
	$ mkdir disks
	$ cd disks
	$ ../bin/qemu-img create -f qcow2 -o preallocation=full hdd.img 512M
``` 
3. Connect the virtual device as a networked block one:
```bash
	$ ../bin/qemu-nbd --connect=/dev/nbd0 hdd.img
```
4. Creating a valid filesystem inside the connected block device (e.g., `/dev/nbd0` in our example). To this end, the following command can be used (<type> can be any of the valid linux filesystems, i.e., *ext2*,*ext3*, *ext4*, *xfs*, *btrfs*, *vfat*, *sysfs*, *proc*, *nfs* and *cifs*):
```bash
	$ sudo mkfs.<type> /dev/nbd0
```	
5. Find the virtual disk partition ():
```bash
	$ sudo fdisk /dev/nbd0 -l
```
The output of this command should provide a list of all partiotions inside the created and formatted disk:
```shell 
	Disk /dev/nbd0: 512 MiB, 536870912 bytes, 1048576 sectors
	Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
	Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
	I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
```  
6. Mount the virtual partition (one of those listed in the output of the previous issued command --i.e., the first output line in the point 5.) on a given mounting point (e.g., ./mnt)
```bash
	$ mkdir ./mnt
	$ sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/nbd0 ./mnt 
```
At this point, the disk content can be accesse by reading/writing the corresponding mounted folder. For instance, the Golang compiler can be copied inside (note that the folder is mounted by *sudo*-ing the commands, so writing/reading the mounted folder also require to prepend *sudo*):
```bash
	$ cd mnt
	$ sudo mkdir go && sudo mkdir go/bin
	$ sudo cp <path-to-go-compiler>/bin/* go/bin/ 
``` 
7. Unmount the disk and disconnect the networked disk:
```bash
	$ cd .. && sudo umount ./mnt
	$ sudo ../bin/qemu-nbd --disconnect /dev/nbd0
	$ sudo rmmod nbd
```
