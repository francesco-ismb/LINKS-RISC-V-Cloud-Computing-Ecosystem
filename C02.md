## Building the Gnu GCC toolchain
The standard Gnu-GCC toolchain of compilation is required in order to build many of the applications that have to run on the RISCV64 machine and to properly build the *BusyBox* component, which is a single binary wrapping all the main Linux commands used on a standard system. Busybox represents a good choice to start managing an emulated system, without the large overhead of installing an entire (full-fledged) operating system. In the following, the few steps necessary to install the GCC toolchain are reported. Once createdm, this toolchain allows the cross-compilation of code targeting the RISCV64 machines (this should include the suport to various ISA extensions), and so, it can be copied on the targeted (emulated) system.
1. Install all the prerequisite (host system libraries and packages):
```
    $ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade 
    $ sudo apt install ncurses-devel ncurses autoconf automake autotools-dev curl python3 libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev
``` 
2. Cloning the Gnu-GCC toolchain repository (supposing to be in the host directory under which the toolchain should be built --e.g., being in the directory `/home/$USER/riscv64` the following command will clone in the repository in the `/home/$USER/riscv64/riscv-gnu-toolchain` folder the source code):
```bash
    $ cd <toolchain-target-folder>
    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain
```
3. Entering the cloned repository and built it:
```bash
    $ cd riscv-gnu-toolchain
    $ mkdir install
    $ ./configure --prefix=$(pwd)/install
    $ make linux -j $(nproc)
```
Under the `<path-to-riscv-gnu-toolchain>/install/bin` there are the built binaries; possibly, they can be sourced by patching the PATH environmental variable.
