## Running a full-fledged Linux machine
At the end of [chapter 2](https://github.com/francesco-ismb/LINKS-RISC-V-Cloud-Computing-Ecosystem/blob/main/C02.md) a RISCV-64 node running a Linux kernel within a minimalistic box was created. That chapter covers all the necessary steps to create this Linux box along with mounting an external hard drive containing the Golang compiler. Although this configuraiton is enough to create simple programs, it lacks all of those useful features coming with a 'full-fledged' Linux distribution (e.g., availability of a packet manager). In this chapter, the steps for getting a full-fledged Linux-box are provided.

At the moment of writing this guide different Linux flavours are already available supporting RISCV-32 and RISCV-64 architectures. These include well knonw *Fedora* derived and *Ubuntu* derived versions, as well as most recently *Debian* derived distributions. As such, we will provide the necessary steps for installing the *Ubuntu 22.04 (Server) LTS* which is compatible with the RISCV-64 architecture. To do so, there is need for some preliminary step: *i*) creating a virtual disk (see [chapter 1](https://github.com/francesco-ismb/LINKS-RISC-V-Cloud-Computing-Ecosystem/blob/main/C01.md) with enough space to host the operating system and let room for user's applications; *ii*) creating the bootloader jumper (fw_jump.bin) and the bootloader (u-boot.bin)) necessary for loading the live image; *iii*) download and run the ubuntu live image targeting the installation on the virtual drive set up in the first step.

### Step-1: Creating a Virtual HDD ###
The first chapter of this chapter explains how to use the qemu subtools to create an empty virtual hard-drive, so the reader can refer to that chapter for a detailed description. Here, we would like to remark an important aspect that concerns the size of the disk: to accomodate a full-fledged Linux operating system and having still enough free space for developing and running user's applications, we reccomand to set the size to $\ge$ 16.0 GiB. 

The Ubuntu-22.04 LTS image ready for the installation can be downloaded from the following URL: [Ubuntu-image](https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04.3/release/ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-riscv64.img.gz). The downloaded image should be decompressed as follows:
```bash
    $ wget https://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04.3/release/ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-riscv64.img.gz
    $ gzip -d ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-riscv64.img.gz 
```

### Step-2 ####
Once the image and the virtual hard-drive are available, the second step targets the compilation of the firmware used with qemu to boot-up the image (i.e., the Linux kernel). **OpenSBI** provides the capability of building the firmware needed to move from the default (old) RISC-V boot loader to the more modern U-Boot mechanism. The repository is freely available at this [location](https://github.com/riscv-software-src/opensbi.git). The steps necessary to get the binary are as follows:
1. Cloning the repository into a <base-directory>:
```bash
    $ cd <base-directory>
    $ mkdir fw-jump && cd fw-jump
    $ git clone https://github.com/riscv-software-src/opensbi.git
```
2. Configuring the repository for working with a generic platform:
```bash
    $ export CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu-
    $ export PLATFORM_RISCV_XLEN=64 
```
3. Compiling the jump loader:
```bash
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ make PLATFORM=generic O=./build
```

After this, there is necessary to clone the u-boot repository and cross-compiling it as follows:
1. Cloning the repository within a <base-directory>:
```bash
    $ cd <base-directory>
    $ mkdir u-boot && cd u-boot
    $ git clone https://github.com/u-boot/u-boot.git .  
```
2. Configuring the system with the default boot options for qemu (smode allows to enter the bootloader in the supervisor mode):
```bash
    $ make qemu-riscv64_smode_defconfig
```
3. Compiling the 'u-boot' boot-loader:
```bash
    $ mkdir build
    $ CROSS_COMPILE=riscv64-linux-gnu- O=./build make -j$(nproc)
```

At this point, both the `u-boot.bin` and `fw-jump.bin` files should have been generated; they can be conveniently copied into a generic folder (e.g., named fw-kernels) where theyr can be retrieved or easily pointed by the qemu emulator:
```bash
    $ mkdir fw-kernels && cd fw-kernels 
    $ cp <path-to-u-boot>/u-boot.bin .
    $ cp <path-to-fw-jump>/build/platform/generic/firmware/fw-jump.bin .
```

Once all the elements for booting up the ubuntu linux image are ready, we can launch the installation on the virtual hard-drive, using the following qemu configuration. Before looking the configuration-launch script, we provide an example of the folder-tree organization we are going to refer in this chapter:
```bash
    /home/user
    |
    +--- /rv64
           |
           +--- /images
           |        |
           |        +--- ...          
           |        |
           |        +--- ubuntu-22.04.2-live-server-riscv64.img
           |        |
           |        +--- ubuntu-22.04.3-live-server-riscv64.img
           |
           +--- /fw-kernels
           |        |
           |        +--- /fw-jump
           |        |        |
           |        |        +--- /bin
           |        |               |
           |        |               +--- fw-jump.bin
           |        |               |
           |        |               +--- ...
           |        |
           |        +--- /u-boot
           |                |
           |                +--- /bin
           |                        |
           |                        +--- u-boot.bin
           |                        |
           |                        +--- ...
           |
           +--- /storage
                    |
                    +--- hdd_ubuntu.img
                    |
                    +--- ...
```

The configuration script is as follows:
```bash
    #! /bin/bash
