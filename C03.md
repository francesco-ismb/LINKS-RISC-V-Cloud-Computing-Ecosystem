## Running a full-fledged Linux machine
At the end of chapter [2](https://github.com/francesco-ismb/LINKS-RISC-V-Cloud-Computing-Ecosystem/blob/main/C02.md) a RISCV-64 node running a Linux kernel within a minimalistic box was created. That chapter covers all the necessary steps to create this Linux box along with mounting an external hard drive containing the Golang compiler. Although this configuraiton is enough to create simple programs, it lacks all of those useful features coming with a 'full-fledged' Linux distribution (e.g., avaialbility of a packet manager). In this chapter, the steps for getting a full-fledged Linux-box are provided.

At the moment of writing this guide different Linux flavours are already available supporting RISCV-32 and RISCV-64 architectures. These include well knonw *Fedora* derived and *Ubuntu* derived versions, as well as most recently *Debian* derived distributions.
