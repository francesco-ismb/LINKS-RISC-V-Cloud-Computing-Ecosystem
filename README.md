# LINKS-RISC-V-Cloud-Computing-Ecosystem

This reporsitory is intended to keep track of the activities of porting and deploying tools to create a working and production-ready RISC-V based Cloud computing Ecosystem.
As such, these activities include the generation of basic development tools (i.e., compilers, libraries) supporting different programming languages (e.g., Golang, Rust, C/C++, etc.), virtualization tools (i.e., Qemu --for emulation of a 
computing platform, Gem5 simulator, etc.), Cloud tools (Kubernetes, OpenStack, etc.) and virtualization images (Linux).
